Flask is great for prototyping models as web services, but it’s not intended to be used directly in a production environment. 

For a proper deployment of a web application, you’ll want to use a WSGI server, which provides scaling, routing, and load balancing.

If you’re looking to host a web service that needs to handle a large workload, then Gunicorn provides a great solution.

Steps for installation and deployment

pip install gunicorn
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0 echo:app

Once the above steps are completed, replace 0.0.0.0 with the respective public IP of the server instance.
